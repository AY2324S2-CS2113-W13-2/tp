## Overview
*New Feature*: Led the development of the event and deadline logic to handle both dates and times, implemented the 
update function's functionality, and introduced a new feature to check for all the free times in a day based on the 
event timings.

Worked closely with the Task Manager Module to ensure seamless integration and functionality of the new features.

### Summary of Contributions
#### Event and Deadline Logic

tasks.
- Optimized the logic to handle various edge cases and ensure robustness of the application.

#### Update Function's Functionality
- Implemented the update function's functionality, allowing users to modify task details efficiently.
- Ensured the update function's seamless integration with the existing task management system, providing a smooth
user experience.

#### Free Times Feature
- Developed a new feature to check for all the free times in a day based on the event timings, aiding users in 
efficient time management.
- Designed the feature to provide a clear and concise view of free times, enhancing the application's usability.

#### Project Management:
- Maintained issue relevancy on `Issues` page and assigned / deleted / updated issues as necessary.
- Maintained `Milestones` page to reflect actual deliverables and goals as necessary.

### User Guide Contributions

1. **Updating Event, Deadline, and Todo Sections**: I authored comprehensive sections detailing how users can update events, deadlines, and todos within the application. This involved providing clear command formats, usage examples, and expected outputs to guide users through the process effectively.

2. **Free Times Feature**: I introduced a new section dedicated to the Free Times feature, enabling users to identify and utilize their available time slots efficiently. This involved crafting command formats, usage examples, and descriptions to facilitate user understanding.

3. **Base Template and Format for UG**: I established a structured template for the User Guide, ensuring consistency in formatting and organization. By providing a clear outline and table of contents, I facilitated the creation and navigation of content by group mates.

### Developer Guide Contributions

1. **Updating Events, Deadlines, and Todos**: I expanded the Developer Guide with sections detailing the implementation of updating events, deadlines, and todos. This included providing method signatures, parameter descriptions, and functionality explanations to assist developers in understanding and implementing these features. Additionally, I incorporated a Sequence Diagram illustrating the flow of updating tasks within the application.

2. **Exceptions and Logging**: I introduced a section on Exceptions and Logging, outlining how exceptions are handled within the application and the logging mechanisms employed. This involved describing exception classes, logging levels, and error-handling strategies to aid developers in debugging and troubleshooting. Furthermore, I included a Class Diagram depicting the relationship between exception classes and logging components.

3. **Free Time Feature Entry**: I incorporated a new section dedicated to the Free Times feature within the Developer Guide. This involved detailing the functionality, method signatures, and usage examples for developers to integrate this feature seamlessly into the application. Additionally, I included a Sequence Diagram illustrating the process of identifying free time slots and a Class Diagram illustrating the relevant components involved in the feature.

My contributions to both the User Guide and Developer Guide have enriched the documentation, providing users and developers with valuable insights and guidance for utilizing and understanding the application effectively. Through clear explanations, structured formatting, and comprehensive content, I aimed to enhance the overall usability and accessibility of the documentation.
