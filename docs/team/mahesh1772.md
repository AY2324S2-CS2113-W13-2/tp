## Overview

As a dedicated software developer, I have made significant contributions to the task management application, focusing on the user interface and core functionalities. My work includes the development of the `WeekView` and `MonthView` classes, which are central to the application's ability to display tasks in a clear and organized manner. Additionally, I have implemented the `CommandHandler` and `StringParser` classes, which are pivotal in processing user input and executing commands. My efforts also extend to enhancing the `Ui Renderer` class to support the new features I introduced.

#### Specific rendering of week view
- **What it does**: The `WeekView` class provides a detailed visual representation of the user's weekly schedule, organizing tasks by day and time.
- **Justification**: This feature was developed to assist users in managing their weekly tasks more effectively, offering a comprehensive overview of their commitments.
- **Highlights**: The implementation involved creating a dynamic layout that adjusts to the user's settings and the density of scheduled tasks.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring readability and ease of use regardless of the number of tasks presented was a significant challenge, which I addressed through adaptive UI elements.

#### Specific rendering of month view
- **What it does**: The `MonthView` class offers a month-long perspective on the user's tasks and events, emphasizing important dates and deadlines.
- **Justification**: This feature allows users to plan their activities on a monthly basis and quickly identify busy days.
- **Highlights**: I focused on creating an interactive and user-friendly interface that enables users to navigate through months and access detailed views of specific dates.
- **Challenges**: Balancing the display of information to prevent user overwhelm while providing comprehensive details was a complex task that I successfully managed.

#### Command handling and input parsing
- **What it does**: The `CommandHandler` and `StringParser` classes are responsible for interpreting user input and executing the corresponding commands within the application.
- **Justification**: These classes are essential for the application's functionality, allowing users to interact with the system through a command-line interface.
- **Highlights**: I designed these classes to be robust and flexible, capable of handling a wide range of user inputs and providing appropriate feedback.
- **Challenges**: Developing a parsing mechanism that could accurately interpret various user commands and parameters required thorough testing and refinement.

### Contributions to the UG
- Authored comprehensive documentation for the `WeekView` and `MonthView` features, including examples and tips for effective use.
- Wrote clear instructions for using the `CommandHandler` and `StringParser`, ensuring users can easily navigate the application's command-line interface.

### Contributions to the DG
- Documented the architecture and design decisions for the `WeekView` and `MonthView` classes, including their integration with the `Ui Renderer`.
- Detailed the implementation of the `CommandHandler` and `StringParser`, providing insights into the command processing workflow and interaction with other components.
- Included diagrams to illustrate the structure and relationships between the classes I developed.

### Reflection
My involvement in this project has been a profound learning experience, sharpening my skills in UI/UX design, command-line interfaces, and software architecture. The challenges I faced pushed me to innovate and deliver features that significantly improve the user experience. I am eager to continue contributing to the project's success and evolution.
