# Clarence Poh Xiang Jun - Project Portfolio Page
This page outlines what I have done for the module CS2113 - Software Engineering and OOP.

Our project: CLI-nton, a powerful task management application designed to help you stay organized and productive. With a simple command-line interface, CLI-nton makes it easy to manage your tasks, whether they're todos, deadlines, or events.

CLI-nton was an idea sprung by our group's collective minds, and it turned out to be a great practice in SWE as well as programming.
Working with a new language - `Java` - helps to improve our tech stack (and hopefully our resumes!) 

## Overview
Here are my contributions to the project:

- **New Feature**: Created TaskManager as a basis for other members to handle CRUD of basic Tasks.
  - To see how the TaskManager works, view our [DG: TaskManager Component.](../DeveloperGuide.md/#taskmanager-component)
  - Alternatively, view the [GitHub Repo for our DG!](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W13-2/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md)

- **Code Contribution**: [Reposense Link.](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=clarencepohh&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2024-02-23&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

- **Active Code Review**: Constantly monitoring build status of member's PRs, and try to assist in resolving them.

- **Project Management**:
    - Managed release `v2.0` on GitHub.
    - Maintained issue relevancy on `Issues` page and assigned / deleted / updated issues as necessary.
    - Maintained `Milestones` page to reflect actual deliverables and goals as necessary.

- **Enhancement to existing features**:
    - Wrote JUnit tests for TaskManager and Exception related functions: [TaskManager JUnit Tests #115](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/115), 
      [Exceptions JUnit Tests #158](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/158)

- **Documentation**:

  - JavaDocs: 
    - Ensured consistent formatting throughout the codebase for milestones.
    - Wrote JavaDocs for TaskManager and TaskManagerException classes.
    - Completed incomplete JavaDocs for (non-trivial) methods lacking them.
    
  - User Guide:
        - Formatted the UG and created the Table of Contents according to content written by group mates.
        - Maintained image consistency and proper organization of images in their respective folders.
        - Alternatively, view the [GitHub Repo for our UG!](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W13-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md)
  
  - Developer Guide:
      - Formatted the DG and created the Table of Contents according to content written by group mates.
      - Handled the overall flow of DG to ensure reading ease for developers.
      - Wrote the Data component in the DG and created their respective UML diagrams [DG: Data Component](../DeveloperGuide.md/#data-component).
      - Maintained the Appendix in the DG to reflect our application needs. See [DG: Appendix](../DeveloperGuide.md/#appendix-requirements).

- **Community Contributions**:

  - Reviewed fellow course-mates PRs with possible improvements [(T09-3: StockPal)](https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2324S2/tp/pull/1),
  [(T13-3: Classify)](https://github.com/clarencepohh/ped/issues)
  - Tried to assist course-mates with their queries on the course forum [(Query on I/O redirection test failure)](https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2324S2/forum/issues/38#issuecomment-2049388702), 
  [(Query on Error Code 126)](https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2324S2/forum/issues/31)

- **Reflection**:
  - Working on this project allowed me to understand what it would be like working in the future as a software developer.
  I learnt plenty about the workflows used as well as tools that software engineers use in their day-to-day. The process 
  was very enriching and I greatly enjoyed working with my teammates and solving problems together. I hope that the 
  experience I have gained through this module will bring me further in my path, and that I will be able to be part of 
  this style of workflows soon enough in the future! Thank you, CS2113! :)
