![img.png](images/Before-Deletion-Week_View.png)

This is how your calender would look like in Week View after deleting a task:
![img.png](images/After-Deletion-Week-View.png)

The behaviour of the program would be the same in Month View as well.

If the task that is being attempted to be deleted does not exist, an error message will be displayed 
(*So please make sure you check the correct dates!*).

### Marking a Task as Complete or Incomplete: `mark`

Marks a task as complete or not complete.

ics, import, tasks.ics
```

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: You can transfer your data to another computer by copying the data file saved in the CLI-nton application directory. The data file is typically named `clintonData.txt` and contains all your tasks. Simply copy this file to the same location on the other computer to transfer your tasks.

**Q**: When adding an Event task, I entered `add,1,E,Event 1` to add an event on the first day of the month, but after that, I was prompted to enter the start date again. Why is that?

**A**: Not to worry! Our program registers the start date as the date you keyed into the original command, i.e. the first day of the month. The subsequent prompt for the start date is for formatting purposes and will not affect the actual date of the event.

**Q**: I have an event lasting from 15 Apr to 19 Apr within a week. Why is it that `free, 16` shows that the day is free?

**A**: For events which stretch over multiple days, we only consider the original day of the event when calculating free times. In this case, the event starts on the 15th and ends on the 19th, so the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th are considered free days. Our advise: add events with their corresponding timings for each day of the event to get a more accurate representation of your schedule.

**Q**: Does the scheduler account for clashes in event timings?

**A**: No. This is to accommodate for users who may have overlapping events or tasks. We recommend users to manually check for clashes and adjust their schedules accordingly.

**Q**: I accidentally typed in a wrong command after CLI-nton asked me "Do you want to update the start and end dates and times? (yes/no)". It says "Event Updated.", but the Date/Time is not updated. What does it mean?

**A**: The message "Event Updated." is a general message to indicate that the event has been updated. However, in this case, the date/time was not updated as the user did not provide the correct input. We recommend users to carefully follow the instructions and provide the correct input to ensure that the task is updated accurately.
